I made[ this ](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=36507)small platformer game with a my SO and a couple of friends. It was created with Pico8.   
I came across it when it was launched with the wildly successful console [PocketCHIP](https://shop.pocketchip.co/). We made it super hard so it lasts for a couple of minutes.   
Check it out here:
